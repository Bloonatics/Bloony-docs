## About

Customisable Synchronised Moderation System (CSMS) is a powerful and reliable global moderation system which aims to maximize moderation efficiency and improve the communication of moderators between servers. CSMS allows server admins to build report handling system by their own, it provides various of settings such as permissions and status for you to customise your own system. Let't get started by creating a group.

## Build your own report handling system

To get started, run `/csms group list` and click the big green button "Create CSMS Group" and enter a nice name for it. Nice, you have successfully created a new, tiny report handling system. Remember each server is only allowed to create one group.

## Accessibility

You should change your group status instead of leaving it closed otherwise your partners cannot join your group. Try out `/csms group manage` with your group ID and change the status to either `open` or `require application`. If you set it to `open`, everyone is allowed to join your group without fulfilling any requirements. If you set it to `require application`, people cannot join your group instantly and it is a recommended option, for safety reasons. Congrats! Your have done setting up your group. Your friends can now join your group by running `/csms group view` with your group ID.

## Get ready to handle reports

After setting up your group and inviting your friend's servers, nice! You are now a global moderator and you can start handling reports. When there are some annoying people breaking rules in your server, spamming or posting server invite links, you can prefer submitting a report by running `/csms report submit` with your group ID, the offender ID and a reason rather than just ban them in your server. After submitting your report, the offender will be banned instantly in your server and the report will show up in `/csms report view`. Your partners can review reports regularly and get rid of the rule breakers. In conclusion, CSMS is a helpful tool for servers to build up  a better mod connection. Let's get started, Shall we?
